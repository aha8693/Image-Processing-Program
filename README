#This program is the midterm project for Intermediate Programming course. 

This program will be an image processing program, in the vein of Photoshop! 
It will have a command-line-based user interface (UI), so there will be no graphical interface, 
and the range of operations will be limited, but the algorithms you will use are similar to the ones used in programs like Photoshop or GIMP.

At a basic level, the program will be able to read image files from disk, perform one of a variety of image processing tasks, 
and then write the result back to disk as a new image file.
